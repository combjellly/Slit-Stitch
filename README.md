# Slit-Stitch
Virtual Slit Scanning environment using Pure Data &amp; Python

# About

Open GL based sofwtare that enables for real time segmenting and stitching of photographs to achieve similar effects to that of slit scan photography. Much like a pin hole camera, the software has a segment that is exposed to the image the user chooses. Using the mouse, the user can control where the image is in this segment, allowing for pixels to be recorded to many smaller images 1px wide. These are then stitched together using a simple python script to be a continuous image.
